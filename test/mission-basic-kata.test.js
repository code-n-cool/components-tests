  // ✅ #daniel TASK: Run the testing and ensure the the next simplistic test pass
  test('Just checking that testing works on your machine', () => {
    expect('Me enjoying in the integration test workshop').toBeTruthy();
    // 💡 TIP: The the tests in watch mode: run test:dev
    // 💡 TIP: When in watch mode, within the terminal/CMD type "p" -> Then start typing this file name, choose it
    //  It should run only this file. Click "w" to return to the main menu
  });

  // #daniel ✅ TASK: Test that when a new event is posted to /event route, if category or temperature are not specified -> the API returns HTTP 400
  // 💡 TIP: Down below, there is an example event schema
  test('When category is not specified, should get http 400 error', async () => {
    // Arrange
    const eventToAdd = {
      temperature: 20,
      name: 'Thermostat-temperature', // This must be unique
      color: 'Green',
      weight: 80,
      status: 'active',
      // 💡 TIP: Consider explicitly specify that category is undefined
    };

    // Act
    // 💡 TIP: use any http client lib like Axios OR supertest
    // 💡 TIP: This is how it is done with Supertest -> await request(expressApp).post("/sensor-events").send(eventToAdd);

    // Assert
    // 💡 TIP: verify that status is 400
  });

  // ✅ TASK: Test that when a new event is posted to /sensor-events route, the temperature is not specified -> the event is NOT saved to the DB!
  // 💡 TIP: Testing the response is not enough, the adequate state (e.g. DB) should also satisfy the expectation

  // ✅ TASK: Test that when a new valid event is posted to /sensor-events route, we get back a valid response
  // 💡 TIP: Consider both the HTTP status and the body

  // ✅ TASK: Test that when a new valid event is posted to /sensor-events route, it's indeed retrievable from the DB
  // 💡 TIP: Whenever possible, use the public API for verification

  // ✅ TASK: Test that querying the GET:/sensor-events route, it returns the right event when a single event exist
  // 💡 TIP: Ensure that exactly one was returned and that this is the right event
  // 💡 TIP: Try using as few assertions as possible, maybe even only one

  // ✅ TASK: Test that querying the GET:/sensor-events route, it returns the right events when multiple events exist
  // 💡 TIP: Ensure that all the relevant events were returned

  // ✅ TASK: Test that querying for /sensor-events route and sorting by the field 'name', the results are indeed sorted
  // 💡 TIP: Each test should be independent and might run alone without others, don't count on data (events) from other tests

  // ✅ Learning TASK: Test that when a new valid event is posted to /sensor-events route, if the temperature exceeds 50 degree a notification is being sent
  // 💡 TIP: This was not covered in the course. To achieve this read about the library 'nock' which can verify that the /localhost/notification service was called

  // ✅ Ensure that the webserver is closed when all the tests are completed
  // 💡 TIP: Use the right test hook to call the API and instruct it to close

  // ✅ Spread your tests across multiple files, let the test runner invoke tests in multiple processes - Ensure all pass
  // 💡 TIP: You might face port collision where two APIs instances try to open the same port
  // 💡 TIP: Use the flag 'jest --maxWorkers=<num>'. Assign zero for max value of some specific number greater than 1

  // ✅ Ensure that the app is read for production and can stat listening to requests not only during testing
  // 💡 TIP: Sometimes we focus only on testing and it might happen that the app can't bootstrap and listen in a production scenario
